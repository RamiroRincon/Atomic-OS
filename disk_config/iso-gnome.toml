[customizations.installer]
# We do not need to disable modules. The default behavior is correct.
# We do not need a %post script. The builder automatically installs the image defined in build-disk.yml.

[customizations.user]
# It is highly recommended to add a user here, specifically for Atomic desktops
# so you don't run into issues with the first-boot setup.
# Replace 'ramiro' and the ssh-key with your actual details if desired.
# If you prefer to set the password in the GUI during install, you can omit this block,
# BUT you must ensure the "Users" module is NOT disabled (which we fixed by removing the disable block).

[[customizations.user]]
name = "admin"
description = "Administrator"
password = "admin" # Change this or use 'key' below for SSH
