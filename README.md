# ⚛️ Atomic-OS
### *Stability of a Server. Experience of a Mac. Core of a Gaming OS.*

Atomic-OS is a refined, **immutable** Linux distribution built on the rock-solid foundation of Fedora Silverblue. It is engineered for users who demand a premium, "out-of-the-box" GNOME experience without the setup fatigue.

## 🌟 Why Atomic-OS?

Most distributions give you the ingredients; **Atomic-OS gives you the meal.** By leveraging `bootc` technology, we treat the operating system like a container—offering a system that is virtually impossible to break and effortless to roll back.

### 🎨 Refined Aesthetics
Experience a desktop that feels expensive. We’ve integrated **Apple’s SF Pro fonts** and curated a GNOME environment that prioritizes clean lines, intuitive workflows, and high-fidelity typography.

### 🎮 Gaming DNA
Don't waste hours in the terminal. Atomic-OS comes pre-tuned for high-performance gaming. With essential kernel tweaks and performance optimizations baked in, your system is ready for Steam, Lutris, and beyond from the first boot.

### 🛡️ Atomic Reliability
Powered by an **immutable core**. Your system files are protected in a read-only "Gold Master" state. Update with confidence, knowing that a perfect snapshot of your OS is always one reboot away.
